# simple-light-paint-with-processing-and-ffmpeg

Download https://processing.org/download (i download a old version 2.2.1 because my pc have 32bit and low performance.

I see that bitmap is very quickly that png ( but need more space for images).

Download https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html for transform bitmaps to mp4 (you can use another program if you want.
