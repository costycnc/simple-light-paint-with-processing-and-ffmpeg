# simple-light-paint-with-processing-and-ffmpeg

Download https://processing.org/download (i download a old version 2.2.1 because my pc have 32bit and low performance).

I use processing for read all frames from video and work with pixels , after any frame will save as bitmap automatically.

I see that bitmap is very quickly that png ( but need more space for images).

Download https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html for transform bitmaps to mp4 (you can use another program if you want.

How working :

1.Open file costy_pda.pde with processing .At line 4 change with name of you video.

2.When click play icon of processing program will appear frame by frame your video with result that consist in long line led.

3.Open folder with all bitmaps created and insert file movie.bat and ffmpeg.exe

4.run movie.bat 

5. Result need to be out1.mp4 that is you video.

Enjoy!

I build a foam cutter machine and i have a idea to put a led to trace movement with cnc ...

And this is result https://youtu.be/UFm4EbDMzPE

For better result create a video with low light ... because white light can influence the result!
